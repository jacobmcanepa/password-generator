# Jacob Canepa's Password Generator 


In this challenge I was tasked to to design the functionality of a password generator. Switching my brain to think like a javascript developer was easily the toughest part of this challenge. Most blocks of JS have to be rigorously processed in order to make it through my thick skull but some lines have started slide in no problem and make sense. I'm sure just being able to read lines of code without having to physically translate them into english will become more frequent with practice.
